            Year-round, seasonal winter, and summer seasonal jobs
        </h3>
        <p>
            We offer hospitality positions year-round, but also offer many seasonal jobs during our summer high-season, including approximately 30 camp counselor positions, for our renowned Summer Family Camp (We will begin accepting applications for summer positions on Jan. 1st).  We also offer winter seasonal jobs (especially for snow sports & activities counselors).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>We welcome employees from the US and around the world</b><br>
            We welcome both local and US Nationals who love the great outdoors, and also encourage international job candidates who have a strong command of English to apply.  Montecito Sequoia has  a long history of employing international counselors, particularly for our summer family camp counselor positions.  We even host an International Night as part of our Summer Family Camp program, as our camp families love to meet and experience counselors from around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Award-Winning Property & Staff</b><br>
            We are very proud to have been named to the <em>TripAdvisor Hall of FameÂ®</em> in 2015, and have received the <em>TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence</em> for over 7 years in a row.  Most recently, Montecito was selected as a <em>"Travelers' Choice" Property for 2020, 2021, 2022 & 2023 by TripAdvisor</em>.  We believe that these accolades are largely due to the excellence of our staff, their focus on customer service, and the fact that they enjoy our guests, their co-workers, their jobs, and our stunning mountain location and life-style.

            Outdoor Activities
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are situated on 40 acres of National Forest Service land at an altitude of 7,400 feet, with a private lake, a year-round hot tub, a seasonal pool, amazing views of the Great Western Divide Mountains, and close proximity to the Giant Sequoia Trees for which these parks are famous.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to our extensive mountain sports & activities program, both on-site & within the parks, our staff members have free access to enjoy many outdoor recreation opportunities when they are off work, and, as a result, our staff share amazing experiences together, and make friendships for a lifetime.

            Staff Room & Board
        </h3>
        <p>
            Due to our remote location (about an 1 1/2 hr. drive time to Fresno, CA), most of our staff live on-site at Montecito.  If you live onsite you will receive subsidized room and board (including satellite internet, satellite telephone access & laundry service during the summer season; it is important to note that there is no cell service in our remote location, but we offer free WiFi).  The staff dines along with our guests, and shares the same buffet meals.  Staff that live off-site have meal privileges during their shifts.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Staff housing varies based on job position, but most seasonal summer staff share summer cabins with other seasonal staff (average of 6 people to a cabin).  Summer seasonal staff utilize one of two shared bathhouses, that are also used by some cabin guests.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Year-round staff generally share a small dorm-room type housing with one other person, with some individual units available as well.  Most staff share shower/bathroom facilities with other staff.  
        </p>

            Qualities we look for in potential employees
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our employees become part of the Montecito Family, and often become friends with not only our staff, but with our guests.  Many of our guests return year-after-year, and they and their children become very close to our staff.  Therefore it is very important that staff members represent Montecito well, set a good example for our young guests, and behave professionally at all times.  Many of our seasonal staff return year-after-year as well, because they enjoy the working environment and the friendships they share at Montecito.
