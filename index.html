                Montecito Sequoia Lodge is an award-winning, all-inclusive, family-friendly lodge, located in the Giant Sequoia National Monument on National Forest Service land, and inside the gates of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks.
            </p>

                <strong>ALL-INCLUSIVE RATES: LODGING, MEALS & ACTIVITIES</strong><br>

            <p>
                Founded over 50 years ago, our rustic year-round lodge is on 40 acres of Sequoia National Forest land.  At an altitude of 7,400 feet, Montecito is surrounded by the grandeur of Sequoia & Kings Canyon, with easy access to the most popular sights within both parks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our property features a small private lake exclusively for our guests, offers stunning mountain views of the Great Western Divide, while being located only minutes away from the magnificent Giant Sequoia Groves for which these parks are famous.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, we are located about midway between the General Sherman Tree in Sequoia National Park, and the General Grant Tree in Kings Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
                While renowned for our premier Summer Family Camp, whether you are planning to visit in Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, or during the Holidays, Montecito Sequoia Lodge offers the best value on the mountain, featuring lodging, meals, and seasonal activities for everyone in your family!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only do we offer seasonal activities daily, but we have our year-round outdoor hot tub available for guests to relax in after a day of hiking, playing, and exploring, and a seasonal outdoor swimming pool that the kids are sure to enjoy!
            </p>
            <p>
                In the evenings, our counselors host a family activity, or you can choose to relax by the fireplace with a book or a glass of wine, while your children eat s'mores, play foosball, ping pong, or board games, with the new friends they will meet at Montecito.  Your kids won't even miss their electronics, because they will be having so much old-fashioned outdoor fun!
            </p>

            <p>
                With the exception of our New Forest Cabins, most of our accommodations are older, as they were originally built while Montecito was a prestigious Girls' Camp in the 1970s.  However, all of our accommodations have recently been remodeled for your family's comfort, while still retaining a vintage camp feel.  Each has a private bath, except for our Rustic Mountain View Cabins, which utilize a shared bathhouse nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you desire more upscale lodging, we strongly recommend our newly-built Forest Cabins, which were architecturally designed to let the outdoors in, and feature floor-to-ceiling windows, private baths, and a deck.  They are so beautiful and quiet, you may never want to leave your cabin - although the stunning scenery viewed through the massive windows will beckon you out-of-doors.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important that our guests know that our accommodations do not have tvs or phones in the rooms to distract you from the natural beauty of the parks.  We do offer free Wi-Fi to our guests, but please be aware that we are reliant on satellites for our Wi-Fi service due to our remote mountain location.  At times of high-use, our Wi-Fi will be slower than most of our guests are used to at home.  Also due to our remote location, there is no cell service on our property, but our Front Desk can help guests that need to make or receive calls.  We also feature a communal TV in our Ponderosa Activity Room, for family-friendly viewing (including important sporting events).

                <div data-editable>"Best family vacation ever!  We have gone for 4 years and plan to keep going back.  It is truly the only place where children can be safely independent from their parents while enjoying new friends and activities.  Parents can relax and enjoy their own activities since they know their kids are safe and happy.  Montecito Sequoia Lodge has the BEST staff ever and we always look forward to seeing them again!"</div>

This was my family's 6th consecutive year and it just keeps getting better! We drove from San Diego for 3 years...now we fly from Virginia. No matter where we live in the world, it's worth the effort to spend time at Montecito in the summer. Now 1 week is not enough...this year we spent 2 weeks and it flew by!!
