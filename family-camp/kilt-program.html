            <strong>January 1 - February 15, 2024</strong><br>
            Rolling admissions period; similar to many colleges, we look at applications as they come in, until all the spaces in the KILT Program are filled.  Applying early gives your teen the best chance to gain acceptance into the program, although it is no guarantee as we have many more applicants than spots available.  We recommend being flexible in which session(s) you can attend for the best chance for entry into the program.<br>
            Please note that returning KILTs in good standing do have priority should they choose to return to their session, but returning KILTs who wait to submit an application until late in the process may lose this priority, and may not get their preferred session dates or even gain acceptance if applying late.

            Accepted KILT applicants will be notified via email by March 1, 2024.  The $250 non-refundable deposit is due upon acceptance into the program and must be paid no later than March 8, 2024 to guarantee your KILT's spot in the program

            Montecito Sequoia KILT Program

        <p>
            The Montecito Sequoia KILT Program ('Kampers In Leadership' Training) is a work experience and leadership training program for high school teens, designed to prepare them for their first real jobs and the college admissions process.  KILTs learn leadership skills, gain experience in working with children & adults, develop good work habits, and have some serious fun!<br>
            KILTs will also participate in some camp cleaning/beautifying projects (such as helping out the lodge/dining room/kitchen staff with hospitality work and set up/clean up areas of camp for special events).  This is an important part of the "work" portion of our KILT program.  KILTs who do not help out when asked will not be welcome to return as we expect our KILTs to be team players.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning text-center px-5" role="alert">
            <p>
                Participants must be at least entering their freshman year of high school, and under the age of 18 during their KILT session, in order to be eligible for the program; There are openings for 10 teens in our boys' cabin and 10 teens in our girls' cabin for each 3-week residential session.  Our KILT Program is VERY competitive and return KILTs in good standing have priority.  First year KILTs whose parents are attending Family Camp and/or come from long-term Family Camp families also have priority, but are not guaranteed admission due to the competition to get into our program.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>First-year/New KILT applicants must also provide 3 references</strong> (e.g. teachers, coaches, volunteer coordinators, employers, a family friend, etc.) to provide a personal recommendation.  KILT applicant is to provide each recommender with a link to our Electronic Reference Form or a copy of our Paper Reference Form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Personal Qualifications</strong><br>
            Applicants should have either previous camping experience or have lived away from home for three or more weeks.  They should enjoy the camp environment and routines, and be eager to build leadership and work-related training skills.  We seek teens who are healthy, energetic, excited about learning, and capable of assuming responsibilities.  They must be of fine character, and mature to the point where they are able to concentrate on developing leadership skills instead of focusing on personal problems.  It is essential that KILTs be good role models for the children and young people in camp.  As such, they must have patience, enthusiasm, the highest level of personal integrity, and dress and act appropriately.  It is important that they are team players, and listen to and be respectful of our guests, staff and Montecito management.

        <p>
            Girls and boys in the program live in separate cabins under the direct supervision of the KILT Director and KILT Counselor (KILT Mom or Dad).  KILTs are assigned to approximately 6-8 hours of responsibility each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            During each year in the program, KILTs learn specific skills within each activity area.  A first year KILT will gain general knowledge of all activities offered at camp.  In subsequent years, returning KILTs spend more time at activities of their choosing to develop expertise, and are eventually able to lead activities on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leadership training occurs through scheduled workshops and supervised practical experiences.

            KILTs should plan to arrive by 3:00 PM the Sunday their session begins and depart by 12 Noon the Saturday their session ends.  Transportation from Fresno International Airport or the Amtrak station is available for an additional fee.  KILTs who plan to arrive the Saturday before their session begins must be chaperoned by a parent for the night, and must book a lodge room or cabin at Montecito, or elsewhere in the parks.  KILT parents coming to pick up their child, who plan to stay the Friday night before, or who plan to watch their 4-year KILT graduation, must book a room at our sister property, <a class="link-arrow" href="/stony-creek-lodge">Stony Creek Lodge</a>, or elsewhere in the parks, if not already attending Family Camp during your teen's KILT graduation

        <h3 class="text-center my-4">KILT Graduation</h3>
        <p>
            After successfully completing 4-years in the program, a KILT is eligible to graduate and promote to an honorary counselor, and receive their official "camp" name.
        </p>
        <p>
            KILT graduation usually takes place the Thursday evening prior to the end of each KILT session.  We recommend that Parents of graduating KILTs, who are not already attending Family Camp during the week your teen graduates, book a room at our sister property, <a class="link-arrow" href="/stony-creek-lodge">Stony Creek Lodge</a>, or elsewhere in the parks, if planning to attend the graduation.  We do invite parents of graduating KILTs to join us at Montecito for complimentary meals and activities, from Thursday evening through Saturday morning of your KILT's graduation week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please remember to book early if you are planning to stay in the parks, as rooms sell out fast during the summer season.
