                Since our rates are "all-inclusive," they may appear expensive to some at first glance, but our guests tell us that they appreciate the excellent value they receive during Family Camp, especially since meals, child care, activities, and lots of fun are already included.  Plus we offer many discounted weeks, a referral discount, and an early payment discount, to help our families lower their overall Family Camp rates.

                From "Good Morning America" to Disney's "Family Fun Magazine," and from "Family Travel Forum" to "Babble.com," Montecito Sequoia's Summer Family Camp consistently ranks near the top of Best Family Camps in the US!

            <p>Here's what our Montecito Family Camp guest's have to say</p>

            <p>
                "Our family spent our fourth annual family camp at Montecito this past week. It was another absolutely wonderful family vacation - kids were kept active and busy all day by a tribe of young, fun, dynamic counselors (archery, riflery, arts and crafts, photography, swimming, horse riding, hiking, biking, etc.) while parents relax, join in activities or just do whatever. Everyone eats meals together (which are buffet-style and exceptionally good) which is nice too. Rooms and facilities vary (from cabins to main lodge) but are generally comfortable - please do not come to Montecito expecting the Ritz Carlton, but I guarantee you that the friendships and service you will experience at Montecito will be the best you will find anywhere. Congratulations to the staff at Montecito for truly putting the "family" into Family Camp. It is a unique place, and I hope everyone will experience it for themselves."

                "Can't say enough awesome things about Montecito. It's a true gem hidden in the Sierra Nevada mountains! This was my family's 6th consecutive year and it just keeps getting better! We drove from San Diego for 3 years...now we fly from Virginia. No matter where we live in the world, it's worth the effort to spend time at Montecito in the summer. Now 1 week is not enough...this year we spent 2 weeks and it flew by!! Love the awesome staff!!"

                "This was the best vacation we have ever had. Just got back from a great week. The location could not be more beautiful. The staff was universally great! Fun, helpful and clearly loved their jobs. Tons of activities for both the adults and kids. Gorgeous hikes in the Sequoia National Park, mountain biking, rock climbing, archery, art, yoga and more. I could not recommend this place highly enough. We already know we are going back next year!"
