            Montecito Sequoia Lodge & Summer Family Camp is located inside the Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Park gates, along the Generals Hwy (aka Hwy 198), which is the road in between the parks, connecting Kings Canyon to Sequoia (see map).  While Montecito is actually located on Sequoia National Forest land, you will need to pay the Parks Entrance Fee to drive to our lodge.  Visitors pay only one entrance fee to visit both Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We alway recommend entering the parks at the Northern entrance ("Big Stump" entrance; via Hwy 180), especially in Winter when a portion of Hwy 198 may be closed between the parks, not allowing you access to Montecito from the Southern entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, due to our remote location, some GPS systems will send you the long way up to the parks.  Make sure your GPS follows the directions below to keep your drive as short as possible.  Do NOT take Hwy 245, as it is a long & winding road that will add an extra hour to your drive!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>From the North</b><br>
            Take Hwy 99 South to Hwy 180 East (Kings Canyon, Exit 133).  Follow Hwy 180 East all the way to the Big Stump/Kings Canyon National Park Entrance.  Once you pay your entrance fee, continue on Hwy 180.  Take the 1st RIGHT-hand  turn onto the Generals Highway (aka Hwy 198; direction Sequoia National Park & General Sherman Tree). Drive 7.5 miles, then turn RIGHT at the Montecito Sequoia Lodge (aka Montecito Lake Resort) Entrance sign.  Follow signs to the Main Lodge.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>From the South</b><br>
            Take Hwy 99 North to Hwy 41 North/East to Hwy 180 East (towards Kings Canyon). Follow Hwy 180 East all the way to the Big Stump/Kings Canyon National Park Entrance.  Once you pay your entrance fee, continue on Hwy 180.  Take the 1st RIGHT-hand  turn onto the Generals Highway (aka Hwy 198; direction Sequoia National Park & General Sherman Tree). Drive 7.5 miles, then turn RIGHT at the Montecito Sequoia Lodge (aka Montecito Lake Resort) Entrance sign.  Follow signs to the Main Lodge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entering the Parks from the Southern entrance (via Hwy 198/Sequoia Park Entrance) is very scenic, but will take you much longer to reach Montecito, and <em>we absolutely DO NOT recommend taking this route in Winter</em>, as the section of road between the parks often closes for much of the Winter and you will not be able to access Montecito from the south when the road between the parks is closed.

        <h3 class="text-center my-4">Winter Travel Advisory</h3>
        <p>
            Before your trip, <a class="text-black" href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=36.69677792123302&lon=-118.87413024902344&site=hnx&smap=1&marine=0&unit=0&lg=en#.V0pL1JErLy1">check our Weather Forecast</a> and call the NPS Road Conditions Hotline.   Bring your tire chains, even if you have 4WD or AWD, or you may not be able to enter the parks.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is a snowstorm predicted during your stay, you may get snowed in until the roads are safely plowed/cleared, so we recommend bringing extra supplies with you just in case (such as medications, diapers, wipes, baby formula, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Escort-only Service</b><br>
            Call our Front Desk (1-559-565-3388, press "0") before you leave home, to see if we are on "Escort-only Service" into Montecito.  If we are on escort service, you will need to make a reservation for our escort caravan with our Front Desk (complimentary to our guests), so that we know you will be coming
        </p>
        <p>
            Plan to arrive via the Northern/Kings Canyon "Big Stump" Entrance to the parks via Hwy 180 no later than 5 pm; (There is usually no access to Montecito via the Sequoia "Ash Mountain" Entrance to the south via Hwy 198 during the Winter months)
        </p>
        <p>
            Escorts meet at 5pm in Grant Grove Village (in front of the Grant Grove Village Market & Post Office) and caravan into Montecito at 5:30 pm.  Grant Grove Village is located on Hwy 180, approximately 3 miles beyond the parks Northern "Big Stump" Entrance (see map).  Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to arrive early for our escort!        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The park service permits our use of the road ONE TIME PER DAY in each direction. Once at 5:00 pm for incoming guests and 10:00 am for departing guests. If you are unable to arrive at this time, you will be unable to access our resort. These times are not flexible and cannot be changed. If you miss the 5:00 pm escort, we may be able to move your first night's reservation to the John Muir Lodge in Grant Grove Village
