            2024 KILT Applications Timeline
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>January 1, 2024</b><br>
            The 2024 KILT application will be available online for applicants to submit beginning on January 1st; NOTE:  First-time KILT applicants are also required to provide three references (paper or electronic) to be submitted by their referees to us by February 21, 2024. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>January 1 - February 15, 2024</b><br>
            Rolling admissions period; similar to many colleges, we look at applications as they come in, until all the spaces in the KILT Program are filled.  Applying early gives your teen the best chance to gain acceptance into the program, although it is no guarantee as we have many more applicants than spots available.  We recommend being flexible in which session(s) you can attend for the best chance for entry into the program.<br>
            Please note that returning KILTs in good standing do have priority should they choose to return to their session, but returning KILTs who wait to submit an application until late in the process may lose this priority, and may not get their preferred session dates or even gain acceptance if applying late.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>February 21, 2024</b><br>
            Deadline for First-Year Applicants' References to be submitted/received.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>March 1, 2024</b><br>
            Accepted KILT applicants will be notified via email by March 1, 2024.  The $250 non-refundable deposit is due upon acceptance into the program and must be paid no later than March 8, 2024 to guarantee your KILT's spot in the program
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>April 1, 2024</b><br>
            KILT tuition balance must be fully paid by April 1st, 2024, along with your teen's KILT Paperwork (which will be sent to KILTs upon the offer of acceptance to the program).

            Montecito Sequoia KILT Program
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Montecito Sequoia KILT Program ('Kampers In Leadership' Training) is a work experience and leadership training program for high school teens, designed to prepare them for their first real jobs and the college admissions process.  KILTs learn leadership skills, gain experience in working with children & adults, develop good work habits, and have some serious fun!<br>
            KILTs will also participate in some camp cleaning/beautifying projects (such as helping out the lodge/dining room/kitchen staff with hospitality work and set up/clean up areas of camp for special events).  This is an important part of the "work" portion of our KILT program.  KILTs who do not help out when asked will not be welcome to return as we expect our KILTs to be team players.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning text-center px-5" role="alert">
            Participants must be at least entering their freshman year of high school, and under the age of 18 during their KILT session, in order to be eligible for the program; There are openings for 10 teens in our boys' cabin and 10 teens in our girls' cabin for each 3-week residential session.  Our KILT Program is VERY competitive and return KILTs in good standing have priority.  First year KILTs whose parents are attending Family Camp and/or come from long-term Family Camp families also have priority, but are not guaranteed admission due to the competition to get into our program.
        </div>

        <p>
            <b>First-year/New KILT applicants must also provide 3 references</b> (e.g. teachers, coaches, volunteer coordinators, employers, a family friend, etc.) to provide a personal recommendation.  KILT applicant is to provide each recommender with a link to our Electronic Reference Form or a copy of our Paper Reference Form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Personal Qualifications</b><br>
            Applicants should have either previous camping experience or have lived away from home for three or more weeks.  They should enjoy the camp environment and routines, and be eager to build leadership and work-related training skills.  We seek teens who are healthy, energetic, excited about learning, and capable of assuming responsibilities.  They must be of fine character, and mature to the point where they are able to concentrate on developing leadership skills instead of focusing on personal problems.  It is essential that KILTs be good role models for the children and young people in camp.  As such, they must have patience, enthusiasm, the highest level of personal integrity, and dress and act appropriately.  It is important that they are team players, and listen to and be respectful of our guests, staff and Montecito management.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Program Details</b><br>
            Girls and boys in the program live in separate cabins under the direct supervision of the KILT Director and KILT Counselor (KILT Mom or Dad).  KILTs are assigned to approximately 6-8 hours of responsibility each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            During each year in the program, KILTs learn specific skills within each activity area.  A first year KILT will gain general knowledge of all activities offered at camp.  In subsequent years, returning KILTs spend more time at activities of their choosing to develop expertise, and are eventually able to lead activities on their own.
