            Included in your room rate for your 1st night's stay is the Dinner the evening you arrive, and Breakfast the day you depart.  For each additional night that you stay with us, you will enjoy all three camp meals - Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  Meal times can vary, but follow the above scheduled times for each season (Fall, Winter & Spring versus Summer).
        </p>
        <p>
            Our culinary team focuses on serving California-fresh meals:  including a large and varied salad bar, fresh fruit platters and whole fruit, three hot entrees (including one vegetarian option), and a hot vegetable and/or rice, a soup of the day, and a dessert to finish your meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We offer many items 24-7 for our guests to serve themselves:  including bagels, toast, cereals, sandwich fixings (from our public-access kitchen fridge), granola bars, and other various snacks.
        </p>

            The beverages included in your room rate are also available to guests around-the-clock.  We offer many non-alcoholic drinks from which you can choose including coffee, specialty teas, hot cocoa, flavored waters, juices, milk/almond milk, water, etc.  Should you desire a glass of wine or beer, it can be purchased from our Pine Box Bar.  We also offer soda and sport drinks for purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our culinary team changes menu items to fit the season and offers special holiday-themed meals for all major holidays.  So whether it's a little treat like chocolate-covered strawberries for Valentine's Day, or a traditional Thanksgiving meal with all the fixings, our chefs will make all of your holidays at Montecito special and festive!
        </p>
        <p>
            Meals during our Summer Family Camp are more extravagant too - our chefs serve special items such as a prime rib and crab leg dinner, a wine & cheese welcome reception, and a specialty dessert night!

        <h3 class="text-center my-4">Breakfast</h3>

        <p>
            Our hot breakfast offers traditional breakfast fare such as eggs, pancakes, french toast, bacon or sausage.  We usually offer hot cereal or oatmeal, an assortment of yogurts, fresh fruit, and other items for you to start your day.  During special times like holidays or summer family camp, you might be treated to homemade bagels, or specialty baked goods made right here in our kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we are unusually quiet and don't have a lot of guests,  you may get to enjoy omelets or waffles made-to-order, or other specialty items, due to the limited number of guests.

For those wanting to eat healthier, we also offer a full salad bar at lunch, fresh fruit, and a soup of the day. Want to treat yourself?  We usually offer fresh-baked cookies or some other dessert at lunchtime!  Enjoy!

            --image-max:500px;

        <h3 class="text-center my-4">Pine Box Bar (Alcoholic Beverages & Specialty Drinks)</h3>
        <p>
            Occasionally, we will host a special event that is complimentary to our guests, such as a wine-tasting or wine & cheese welcome reception. However, outside of these special events, alcoholic beverages are not included in your room rate. If you would like to enjoy an alcoholic beverage, we offer an assortment of wines and beers, including special local brews, and some mixed drinks at our Pine Box Bar for purchase. We also allow guests to bring their own alcoholic beverages with them to enjoy, but we do charge a small corkage fee which includes use of our wine openers & wine glasses. Ask the Front Desk when you arrive for more information on operating hours, fees, and pricing, for our Pine Box Bar services.
