            Fall Activities at Montecito
        </h1>
        <p>
            As summer comes to a close, and many children go back to school, Sequoia & Kings Canyon parks become more quiet and peaceful, as Montecito moves into a slower season.  We receive many more International and adult guests in our Fall Season, looking for a place to stay for a night or two, as they explore the National Parks.  We still have families visiting, but we tend to be much less crowded, as guests tend to travel off-campus to visit the sights of our glorious National Parks and Forests.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this transitional season, we offer some of our lowest rates of the year, especially during mid-week stays.  We still offer our all-inclusive package of lodging, meals, and activities, but the pace is not as hectic as in the summer months.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Our fall guests often want to combine visiting the parks' many sights, such as Moro Rock, the General Sherman Tree, Tunnel Tree, and the Grant Tree Grove, while hiking on the nearly empty trails, and enjoying the crisp weather and changing fall foliage.  We still offer a variety of On-site Activities, both counselor-led and self-guided, including our Kids' Program, for those guests wanting to relax and enjoy our Montecito vibe and value.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this season, our offerings are dictated by the weather conditions, as we can experience near summer-like weather on some days, and brisk fall-like days on others.  Occasionally, we'll experience an unseasonably early snow in October, so it's always good to check the weather forecast before coming to Montecito to make sure you are prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the fall, we generally offer the following range of activities, but please note that they are subject to availability and weather conditions.  Also, we rotate activities often, and therefore a specific activity may not be available during the time of your visit.  We generally offer a morning activity period after breakfast,  and an afternoon activity period after lunch.  We host a family-friendly activity in the evening as well.  We post a Daily Activity Schedule during dinnertime, for the following day.  Check it each evening to find out what activities will be offered for the next day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Fall Holidays</b><br>
            We do offer more activities during the holidays to accommodate the increased number of guests, and will also offer thematic activities as well (e.g. Thanksgiving-themed Arts & Crafts projects).  In addition, our culinary team will serve special holiday meals for your family's holiday celebration!  Leave the cooking and cleaning to us, while you enjoy quality time with your family!

        </h3>

        <p>
            <span class="activity">

            </span>
            Indulge your creative spirit!  Enjoy making beaded jewelry, tie-dye, ice candles, batik, and seasonal crafts with our counselors during your stay.  During the summer we have an extensive Arts & Crafts program, so we have all the materials and expertise for our guests who enjoy making crafts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Kids' Program
            </span>
            We do offer daily programming for children ages 5 - 12 years old, especially on the weekends.  Programs are developed by our talented counselors to fit the size and the age range of the kids' group, as well as the weather conditions,  and will include both indoor and outdoor play.  Our children's program during the fall will often include Archery, Canoeing, Arts & Crafts, Fort Building, Climbing our Rock Wall or Bouldering, and Tennis, among other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Archery
            </span>
            "Sight method" is taught, and archers of all abilities enjoy our four staggered targets.  Field archery and novelty shoots (e.g. Balloon Shoot) are also offered.  Ages 7 and up may enjoy archery whenever it is scheduled.  Children ages 5 & 6 can attend with a parent, or with our children's program.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Boating
            </span>
            Glide around lovely Lake Homavalo in a canoe, or a kayak.  Boats are available on a first-come, first-served basis.  Life jackets are required for all boaters, and children must be supervised by a parent when using the boats (unless participating with their kids' group).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Guided Nature Hikes
            </span>
            Join one of our naturalists for a guided hike into the glorious Sierra Nevada.  Hikes range from easy to strenuous, as chosen to fit the group's needs.  Beautiful scenery is guaranteed - we even have amazing hikes right from camp!  The trails are quiet during the fall and the air is invigorating, so it's a great time to hike and explore!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Nightsky
            </span>
            The sky in these parks is so pristinely clear, you can often see the Milky Way, shooting stars, the constellations, and planets at night.  We sometimes offer a nightsky viewing party utilizing our powerful camp telescope.  Let our counselors be your guide to the stars, or sit in our outdoor hot tub, and stargaze to your content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Tennis
            </span>
            Montecito Sequoia Lodge offers 2 tennis courts for guest use.  Grab a friend and head to the our rustic courts - you'll find tennis rackets and balls, and a court surrounded by forest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Rock Climbing/Bouldering
            </span>
            Our ten-foot vertical climbing wall will challenge all levels of climbers, from beginner to advanced.  Let our skilled instructors teach you to climb successfully.  Come enjoy a controlled climb set against a majestic view of the Great Western Divide, or go natural with climbing one of the many boulders dotted throughout our camp, or located nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Yoga
            </span>
            Sometimes we offer Yoga in the fall, if one of our Yogis is visiting the mountain.  It's a great way to relax and center yourself in the great outdoors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="activity">
                Relaxing
            </span>
            You won't need an instructor for this!  Unwind by the fireplace with a good book, play one of the many board games we make available to our guests, challenge your partner or kids to a foosball game or a ping pong match.  Better yet, relax in our jetted outdoor hot tub under the stars, grab a glass of wine from our Pine Box Bar, or a leisurely walk around Lake Homavalo.  Sometimes the best activity is to do nothing at all...please enjoy!
