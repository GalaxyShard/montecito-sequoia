        <p>
            Montecito Sequoia Lodge & Summer Family Camp was founded over 50 years ago, as a girls' leadership camp, by Dr. Virginia Barnes, Ed.D.  Except for our upscale New Forest Cabins and Lakeview Suites, most of our lodging was originally built in 1970 and reflect an older more rustic style, but all of our lodge rooms and cabins have been remodeled with a focus on our guests' comfort. As our Lodge & Camp were founded in 1963, we have tried to retain a vintage camp feel and an old-school National Park lodge vibe to honor our history.  It is also important to keep in mind that our Lodging Rates are All-Inclusive; which include your Lodging, Buffet Meals, Seasonal Activities, and amenities such as a seasonal pool & year-round hot tub too - we believe in providing real value to our guests!
        </p>
        <p>
            For those guests who desire modern accommodations, we recently built our beautiful New Forest Cabins, all with private baths & decks.  Nestled in the woods at the edge of our property, our Forest Cabins are extremely quiet and private.  Designed to let the outdoors in, each Forest Cabin has floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the forest, and an open-concept floor plan with a King bed, master bath, living room and Kitchen/bar area, and private deck on the first floor. The second floor has a small tree-house bunk room, with a 1/2 bath, for the kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not have TVs or phones in our rooms or cabins, as we want our guests to relax and unplug, and spend quality time with their family and fellow guests during their stay with us.  Due to our remote mountain location, we currently offer our guests free Wi-Fi via satellite, which will be slower during times of peak use.  We continue to upgrade our Wi-Fi as new technology becomes available in our area.  We also offer a free satellite phone for our guests to use to make calls as there is no cell service in our remote location.  We have a TV in our communal Ponderosa Room, so our guests can enjoy major sporting events and family-friendly viewing, when appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on our lodging options, please see each individual lodging description.  Rates are All-Inclusive:  Lodging, Buffet-style Meals & Self-guided Activities.
