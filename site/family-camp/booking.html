            Our All-Inclusive Family Camp Packages include Lodging, Buffet meals, 24-hour grab 'n go access to snacks &amp; soft-drinks, and Free-choice Daily and Evening Activities for the entire family, which includes almost 6-hours of child care daily in our Children's Program (ages 2 and up; children under 2 can participate with a parent/adult).
        </p>
        <p>
            Family Camp rates are based on the type of lodging you choose, the week you select, and the number of people per room, per Family Camp week.  Children under the age of 2 are free!
        </p>
        <p>
            With the exception of our New Forest Cabins and our Lakeview Suites, most of our accommodations are older, as they were originally built while Montecito was a prestigious Girls' Camp in the 1970s.  However, all of our accommodations have been remodeled for your family's comfort, while still retaining a vintage camp feel.  Each have private baths, except for our Rustic Mountain View Cabins, which utilize a shared bathhouse nearby.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Our New Forest Cabins are for those guests who want more of the comforts of home during their time at Family Camp.  Designed with floor-to-ceiling windows to let the outdoors in, these beautiful 2-story cabins have almost 1,000 square feet of living space, with an open-concept first floor that includes a King bed, a living area, kitchen/bar area, full bath, and a private outdoor deck with Adirondack chairs.  Upstairs is a small treehouse bunk room for the kids, with its own 1/2 bath.  These cabins were built with natural materials to complement the private &amp; quiet forest setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no TVs or telephones in our accommodations, so you and your children can unplug during your stay.  We do offer free satellite WiFi to our guests.  However, please understand that our WiFi can be subject to slow periods at times due to high demand, our remote location, and the more limited bandwidth available via satellite.  We continue to invest  in our WiFi to offer our  guests the best connectivity possible in our remote, wilderness location.  As always, our front desk can help you with internet access if you have an urgent need to connect.
